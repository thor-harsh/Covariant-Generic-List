# Project--Covariant-Generic-List

<table>

**In this project we will make a Complete Covariant Generic List from Scratch in Scala. It's gonna be amazing and you will learn how we can leverage the power of Scala.** <br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets what does Covariance and Generic Meaning first**?<br></br>


**What does Covariance means**?<br></br>
Covariance. Covariance is a concept that is very straightforward to understand. We say that a type constructor F[_] is covariant if B is a subtype of type A and F[B] is a subtype of type F[A]. In Scala, we declare a covariant type constructor using the notation F[+T], adding a plus sign on the left of the type variable ...<br></br>

**What does Generic means**?<br></br>
Generic classes are classes which take a type as a parameter. They are particularly useful for collection classes.Generic classes take a type as a parameter within square brackets []. One convention is to use the letter T as type parameter identifier, though any parameter name may be used.<br></br>

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section üòÅüòÇ. Thanks!**
